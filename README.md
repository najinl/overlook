# Overlook - Hotel Application

## Abstract
Overlook Hotel is not a creepy hotel...not at all!What it is, however, is an application developed to display tools/skills learned during Module 2 at Turing School of Software & Design. This solo application allows a customer to login to the hotel dashboard and view a history of bookings past or present, the total amount spent at the hotel to-date, and what rooms are available for selected dates based on specific filters.
